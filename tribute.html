				<p>"I am not dedicated to making things easy for my workers. I dedicate myself to making them surpass themselves every day. To do this, you have to unite the entire company and focus on the projects that really matter. Then, I pick the best employees and put them in charge of those projects to motivate the rest and provide them with an aggressive vision of what the product will be like. Only then will we be better."</p>
